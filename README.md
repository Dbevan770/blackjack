This is a simple blackjack game developed in Python 3.9. I created it for fun and to brush up on my Python skills. If there are any bugs please report them. I believe I smoothed out as much as I could.


--Running--
Download 'blackjack.py' while in the folder the file is in run 'python blackjack.py'

That's it! Enjoy the game!
