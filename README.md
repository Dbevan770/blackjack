This is a simple blackjack game developed in Python 3.9. I created it for fun and to brush up on my Python skills. If there are any bugs please report them. I believe I smoothed out as much as I could.


# Running

1. Download 'blackjack.py'.
2. While in the folder the file is in run 'python blackjack.py'.
3. That's it! Enjoy the game!
